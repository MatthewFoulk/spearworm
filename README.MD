# Overview
This project backs is run locally and backs up your Spotify listening history
into a searchable SQL database. There is a simple Flask app that utilizes
Ajax to update the page with search results allowing the user to 
dynamically search throught their listening history. The lyrics of songs
are also pulled in and fully searchable.

The idea behind project was to help you find "earworms", songs that
get stuck in your head but you couldn't remember their names. That is
where the name "Spearworm" comes from: "Spotify + earworm" and the idea
of "spearing" an earworm.

I'm just now writing this README months after I wrote the program, so I can't
remember how functional everything was, but it is something that I actually
found useful for an extended period of time.
